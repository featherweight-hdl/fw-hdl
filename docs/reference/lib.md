# Library classes

Building blocks in `fw_std_pkg` whose cycle behaviour is part of their definition:
credit senders, arbiters, and (to come) tables, pools and queues. Each class states:

- what it **observes** in a cycle;
- what it **consumes**;
- how **ties** break;
- whether a grant can depend on **same-cycle valid**.

The class model implements exactly that, and the RTL is checked against the class
model cycle for cycle. Each class also has a **contract** (a YAML file next to its
source): the order and conservation rules any implementation must keep, whatever its
timing ({doc}`contracts`).

| Class | Source | Form | Lowering |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fw_credit_tx` | `src/std/credit/` | cycle step | its `step()`, mapped |
| `fw_arbiter` | `src/std/arb/` | process | registry entry: the `rr_arb` template ({doc}`registry`) |

## fw_credit_tx

A credit-gated sender over `NVC` virtual channels, with a shared pool and a per-VC
reserve. Its output is valid-only: a value is offered only when its credits are held,
so the receiver never stalls it.

```systemverilog
fw_credit_tx #(type T, int CREDITS, int NVC = 1, int RESERVE = 0,
               fw_credit_policy_e POLICY = FW_CREDIT_POOL_FIRST, int CHECK = 1)
```

| Port | API | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `in[NVC]` | `fw_get_nb_if #(T)` | the values for each VC |
| `cr` | `fw_get_nb_if #(bit [VB-1:0])` | credit returns: the VC one credit comes back to |
| `out` | `fw_valid_put_if #(bit [VB+$bits(T)-1:0])` | `{vc, value}` |

`VB` is `$clog2(NVC)`, and 1 when `NVC` is 1.

**Credits.**
- `CREDITS` is the receiver's buffer, in credits.
- At reset, the credits fill each VC's reserve (`RESERVE`) in VC order, and the rest
  go to the pool. With fewer credits than `NVC * RESERVE`, the later VCs start short.
- A value on VC `v` may be sent when `pool + reserve[v] >= CHECK`, and it spends
  `CHECK` credits:
  - `FW_CREDIT_POOL_FIRST` takes them from the pool first;
  - `FW_CREDIT_VC_FIRST` takes them from the VC's reserve first.
- A returned credit refills its VC's reserve up to `RESERVE`, then the pool.
- A return to a VC at or above `NVC` is dropped.

**Per cycle.**

| | |
|---|---|
| Observes | the credits and holds at the start of the cycle, and one credit return |
| Consumes | at most one value (one send), and one credit return |
| Ties (`NVC > 1`) | round robin over the VCs whose hold is full and whose credits cover `CHECK`, from the VC after the last one sent |
| Same-cycle valid | never decides a send. Every ready comes from registered state, and `cr` is always ready, so a credit return never waits behind data |

A credit returned in a cycle can be spent from the next cycle.

**Latency.**
- `NVC = 1` has no hold. `in[0]` is ready while the credits cover `CHECK`, and a value
  taken is sent in the same cycle. This is the shape of the `credit_tx` IR template, and
  the test checks the two cycle for cycle.
- `NVC > 1` has a one-value hold per VC. `in[v]` is ready while hold `v` is empty or
  is being sent this cycle. A value is sent from the cycle after it arrives, and one VC
  alone streams one value per cycle.

**Contract** (`src/std/credit/fw_credit_tx.yaml`):
- values leave in order within a VC (`per_key`);
- credits spent and not yet returned never exceed `CREDITS`.

**Lowering.** `step()` is mapped (no registry entry). Assign it to XLS by class name in
the knob file, like any component. One activation per cycle, at II=1.

**Tests.**
- `tests/stdlib/fw_credit_tx_unit_test.sv` (SVUnit): empty, credits exhausted and the
  reserve, return timing, round-robin tie, hold latency and rate, reset mid-traffic.
  The contract is checked throughout.
- `tests/xls/lib/test_credit_tx.py`: six parameter sets, with random closed-loop
  stimulus. It checks a Python model of the rules above against the class model, and
  the class model against the RTL cycle for cycle: at 1 and 2 stages, and with I/O
  flops on and off. It also checks `NVC = 1` against the `credit_tx` template.

## fw_arbiter

An `N`-input arbiter, accept-then-arbitrate: one hold per input, with `ready` meaning
the hold is empty. It is in the first-cut form and is recognized by the registry
(`FW_ARB_RR` only). The full per-cycle definition and its policies are next.
